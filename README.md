- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheRobertLing, thought Robert Ling is just an alias that a friend gave me. I don't imagine it's that hard to figure out what my actual name is from just the things on my profile
- 👀 I’m interested in building language learning software and contributing to open source projects
- 📫 How to reach me: lingrobert929@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I would really like to have fun fact but my life is so unbelievably well described by the word 'mediocrity' that there is nothing that I can think of.

- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheRobertLing, thought Robert Ling is just an alias that a friend gave me.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... not much really. I live a pretty boring life outside of university and work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Vue.js and Express.js
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... not much at this point really.
- 📫 How to reach me: lingrobert929@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I would really like to have fun fact but my life is so unbelievably well described by the word 'mediocrity' that there is nothing that I can think of

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TheRobertLing, thought Robert Ling is just an alias that a friend gave me. I don't imagine it's that hard to figure out what my actual name is.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building language learning software and contributing to open source projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Vue.js and Laravel. All I can say is... wow. All those hours spent trying to configure express.js with random npm libraries, and you're telling me laravel has everything built in??? In this economy???
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: lingrobert929@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I would really like to have fun fact but my life is so unbelievably well described by the word 'mediocrity' that there is nothing that I can think of.
